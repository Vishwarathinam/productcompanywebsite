            We are on a mission to save humanity and revive the economy from the catastrophic effects of the pandemic with carrier tracking and non-pharmaceutical interventions.
            Flattening the curve of the Coronavirus is of top priority for almost every country today. Unless they are able to flatten the curve, peoples’ lives, as well as the economy, are in severe danger. We have developed a solution that governments can use to help stop the spread, and tools that will help resume commerce, and even travel.
